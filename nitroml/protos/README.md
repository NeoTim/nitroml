# NitroML protos

This directory contains proto stubs for protos from [tensorflow_metadata](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata). Unfortunately, the stubs for ProblemStatement are not currently included in the current version `v0.22.2`, so we hardcode them here (as opposed to adding a dependency of Bazel).
